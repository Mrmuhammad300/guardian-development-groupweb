  **Design Movement**: Brutalist Minimalism / Institutional Modernism
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Uncompromising Clarity**: Information is presented with absolute precision, no fluff.
  2. **Structural Integrity**: The layout feels built, not just arranged. Heavy use of grid lines and borders.
  3. **Material Honesty**: Visuals reflect the raw materials of development—concrete, steel, glass—but refined.
  4. **Authority through Restraint**: Confidence is shown by what is *not* there.
  **Color Philosophy**:
  *   **Guardian Navy (#0F1F2D)**: The bedrock. Deep, almost black, representing the depth of responsibility.
  *   **Charcoal Slate (#2A2E33)**: The structure. Used for secondary elements and heavy borders.
  *   **Steward Gold (#B89B5E)**: The value. Used extremely sparingly, like a seal of quality or a single beam of light.
  *   **Architect Gray (#E6E8EB)**: The canvas. A cool, technical gray for backgrounds to reduce glare and increase readability.
  **Layout Paradigm**:
  *   **Asymmetric Grid**: A rigid but asymmetric grid system visible through thin borders. Content blocks are offset to create tension and interest without breaking the structure.
  *   **Split-Screen Hero**: Vertical division of the screen, juxtaposing heavy typography with architectural imagery.
  **Signature Elements**:
  *   **Technical Rule Lines**: Thin 1px lines separating sections, reminiscent of blueprints.
  *   **Monospaced Data Points**: Key metrics (years of experience, project value) displayed in a monospaced font to emphasize data integrity.
  *   **The "Keystone" Motif**: A subtle visual anchor (gold square or line) present in every major section header.
  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  *   **Solid Transitions**: No bouncy animations. Elements slide into place with weight and purpose (ease-out-quart).
  *   **Hover States**: Buttons don't just change color; they reveal a structural underline or a "bracket" effect.
  **Animation**:
  *   **Reveal on Scroll**: Content blocks reveal themselves from behind invisible masks, like a building rising.
  *   **Parallax Imagery**: Subtle parallax on architectural photos to give a sense of scale and depth.
  **Typography System**:
  *   **Headlines**: *Playfair Display* (SemiBold). Elegant, editorial, but imposing.
  *   **Body**: *Inter* (Regular). Clean, neutral, highly legible.
  *   **Data/Captions**: *JetBrains Mono* or similar monospaced font for technical details.

  **Design Movement**: Swiss Style / International Typographic Style
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Objective Photography**: Images are documentary-style, showing the reality of the projects.
  2. **Mathematical Grids**: A strict modular grid governs every element.
  3. **Asymmetry**: Dynamic balance achieved through asymmetric layouts.
  4. **Sans-Serif Purity**: Reliance on a strong grotesque sans-serif for everything to convey modernity and transparency.
  **Color Philosophy**:
  *   **Guardian Navy (#0F1F2D)**: Used for high-contrast typography against white.
  *   **White**: Dominant background color to maximize the sense of transparency and "truth."
  *   **Steward Gold (#B89B5E)**: Used only for geometric shapes or large numbers, not for text.
  **Layout Paradigm**:
  *   **Modular Grid**: Content is organized into strict modules.
  *   **Negative Space**: Massive amounts of white space to frame the content and give it importance.
  **Signature Elements**:
  *   **Large Typography**: Headlines are massive, often breaking words or spanning multiple columns.
  *   **Geometric Shapes**: Simple rectangles or lines in Gold to guide the eye.
  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  *   **Snap Scrolling**: Sections snap into place to emphasize the grid.
  *   **Micro-interactions**: Subtle scaling of images on hover.
  **Animation**:
  *   **Staggered Text**: Letters or words slide up in a staggered fashion.
  **Typography System**:
  *   **Headlines**: *Source Sans 3* (Black/Bold). Massive, tight tracking.
  *   **Body**: *Source Sans 3* (Regular).

  **Design Movement**: High-End Editorial / Luxury Real Estate
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Narrative Flow**: The site reads like a magazine feature.
  2. **Atmospheric Imagery**: Images are moody, high-contrast, and evocative.
  3. **Elegant Typography**: Serif fonts take center stage.
  4. **Softness**: Rounded corners and soft shadows to contrast with the hard lines of architecture.
  **Color Philosophy**:
  *   **Guardian Navy**: Used as a rich background for immersive sections.
  *   **Steward Gold**: Used for metallic gradients on text or borders.
  **Layout Paradigm**:
  *   **Overlapping Elements**: Images and text overlap to create depth.
  *   **Centered Layouts**: More traditional, centered layouts for a classic feel.
  **Signature Elements**:
  *   **Serif Drop Caps**: Large drop caps to start sections.
  *   **Image Carousels**: Full-width sliders to showcase projects.
  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  *   **Smooth Scroll**: A "luxurious" smooth scroll effect.
  *   **Fade-ins**: Elements gently fade in.
  **Animation**:
  *   **Slow Zoom**: Images slowly zoom in to create a cinematic feel.
  **Typography System**:
  *   **Headlines**: *Libre Baskerville* (Italic/Regular).
  *   **Body**: *Inter* (Light).
